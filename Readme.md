### Some Assumptions and Decisions About The Challenge

- Used SqLite for SQL database requirement.
- Used Repository Pattern for Data Access.
- Since CRUD were required for User model and data type only has Id, update works for Id
- TransactionId changed to long, since int has good chance to deplete. 
    - Transaction ids are auto generated by db.
- Samples of Unit and Integration Tests are in TaskTransaction.Test project.
